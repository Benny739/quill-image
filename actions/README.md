# Quill Embed Actions

# What is this?

This is a derivation of
[quill-blot-formatter](https://github.com/Fandom-OSS/quill-blot-formatter)
that fully integrates with the Quill Delta format to provide resizable,
floatable images independent from the HTML DOM. This module is ported
from Flow to TypeScript and built with a modern toolchain.
